# Create our dice throwing app consisting of classes interacting with each other.

# You can choose one out of three pathes:
# Hard: write everything from scratch including tests
# Medium: pull the tests write the two classes yourself
# Easy: use the template classes in easy_warmup-006.rb and let it guide you to solve the problem


# Even if you choose the easy challenge, take a bit to think about the fundamentals of your
# dice throwing app.
# What classes do we need? What is their relation to each other? How do the classes interact with each other?

# Write the tests for these classes. What types of tests do we need? Write tests for each class.
# A great book about testing in Ruby and Rails is "Rails 4 Test Prescriptions: Build a Healthy Codebase".

# To summarize some of the app functionality, we want to have for example:
# - creating a single Dice
# - rolling a single Dice
# - display the result for each dice
# - roll all dices we have for our DiceGame
# - user interface (command prompt)
